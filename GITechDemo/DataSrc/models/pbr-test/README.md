The textures used for the PBR material sample spheres were retrieved from [Free PBR Materials](http://freepbr.com/). If you're interested in testing out BRDFs, or need assets/placeholders/etc for your project, you should definitely browse their collection. They are entirely free and they also work with Unreal, Unity and CryEngine.
